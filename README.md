## Information on the Training/Test datasets

## 1. Speech
##### a. Speakers: 6 males, 7 females, 4 children
##### b. Contents: 31 sentences to ask help, i.e. ‘Help!’, ‘We are here’ (See Appendix.)
##### c. Recording condition: Anechoic chamber (Low cutoff 80 Hz), Condenser microphone (Shure SM81)
##### d. Sampling frequency and file length: 48 kHz, 0.5 – 3 seconds

## 2. Drone noise
##### a. Drone models: Parrot Mambo FPV (18 x 18 cm), DJI Phantom 4 (25 x 25 cm), Tarot T810 FPV (81 x 81 cm)
##### b. Recording condition: flat and wide playfield, Stereo microphone (Sony PCM-A10) with the wind screen
##### c. Sampling frequency and file length: 48 kHz, 1 - 5 seconds

## 3. Convolution and mixing
##### a. Summary: Instead of playing back a speech signal with a loudspeaker, the transfer function between the loudspeaker and microphones were measured, and convoluted with a speech signal. Then, these convoluted speech signals are mixed with the drone noise. The speech, drone noise, and the transfer functions are selected at random. 
##### b. Measurement of the transfer functions: in a playfield, the transfer functions between a loudspeaker (Genelec 8040B) and two microphones (Sony PCM-10) were measured using white noise (temperature 21-23 ℃, humidity 26-31 %). 
##### c. Sampling frequency and file length: 48 kHz, 1 – 5 seconds (speech signals are always overlapped with drone noise signals).
##### d. SNR: Minimum -50 dB to maximum 10 dB
